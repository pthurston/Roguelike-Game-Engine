Roguelike-Game-Engine
=====================

After using the Unity engine for hobby game development for a few years I decided that I wanted to try my hand at coding my own game using a built from scratch game engine so that I could learn from the ground up how games are made.

This game is written in C++ and uses the libtcod library which provides the rendering features needed for the game. 

Tasks:
[x] Allow for multiple persistent levels of the dungeon
[x] Add chests that can contain multiple items
[ ] Add a special overworld level which allows the player to travel between multiple dungeons
[ ] Improve monster ai
[ ] Add light intensity around the player (the map gets darker further away from the player, simulating a torch)
